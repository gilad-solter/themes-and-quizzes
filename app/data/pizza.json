    "You got: Overwhelmed By Life. You often feel like everyone knows what they’re doing — everyone except you. You feel like you’re just floundering while friends and family are living their dreams. The truth, however, is you’re doing just fine and you’d probably feel a lot better if you didn’t put so much unnecessary pressure on yourself.",
    "You got: Creative Genius! You might not be an artist in the traditional sense, but you’ve got a truly creative soul. You make bold, unexpected choices, and they almost always pay off!"
